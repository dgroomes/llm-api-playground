ðŸ“š Learning and exploring LLM APIs like that of OpenAI and Anthropic.


## Overview

I want (need) to learn about today's disruptive AI concepts like *large language models* (LLMs). Conveniently, these
models are easily accessed via HTTP/JSON APIs. This repository captures my notes and runnable example code for
interacting with LLM APIs.

I want some personal reference code, I want to learn the core trivia about these APIs, and even more importantly I want
to keeping building my intuition about how best to use LLMs to enrich a software system. I want an intuition about
ability, cost, latency, context size, and more.


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to run the LLM-powered `tic-tac-toe` game.

1. Pre-requisite: [Nushell](https://github.com/nushell/nushell)
2. Make an OpenAI API key available via environment variable
    * ```nushell
      $env.TIC_TAC_TOE_API_KEY = (input -s)
      ```
3. Overlay the game commands
    * ```nushell
      overlay use --prefix tic-tac-toe/tic-tac-toe.nu as tic
      ```
4. Play the game!
    * Use natural language to describe where to place your 'X'. Ask the LLM to take their turn, and rejoice in the LLM
      either figuring things out OR in it making silly mistakes. For example.
    * ```nushell
      tic play "go in the middle middle"
      ```
    * ```nushell
      tic board
      ```
    * ```nushell
      tic play "your turn"
      ```
    * ```nushell
      tic play "remove X in top right"
      ```
    * ```nushell
      tic new-game
      ```


## Glossary

This is a glossary of terms I'm learning about. When I'm in a new field and I can't keep up with the terms (they don't
stick in my memory), I need to organize them onto paper, rehearse them, and compare and contrast them.

*completion*: The text output of the GPT model after processing a prompt. This is an OpenAI term or is it broad?

*prompt*: The text input to the GPT model. This is a term used broadly in the space. 

*prefix prompt*: This is a normal prompt. The prompt comes before (hence "prefix") the completion. Contrast this with
a suffix prompt.

*suffix prompt*: This is a prompt that comes after the completion. This is useful if you want to get a completion that
bridges the gap between a leading thought and a trailing thought. Interesting. Would like to try it.

*token*: Words or chunks of characters. This is a unit of measure. It is used for measuring complexity and pricing.

*context length*: The model (is this even the right word?) can keep track of only so much context when it's doing its thing.
The maximum context length for most OpenAI models is 2048 tokens. (How does Copilot treat context? Doesn't it send the
whole file contents to the model? Is it an "embedding"?).

*model*: This is an instance of the thing (neural network?) trained on a data set. OpenAI has various GPT-3 models like Ada
and Davinci.

*GPT*: Generative Pre-trained Transformer.

*temperature*: (Interesting, but I'll skip for now.)


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] Anthropic example requests
* [ ] Prompt caching
* [ ] HOLD (I need more debuggability/auditing) More examples in the tic-tac-toe prompt. It's surprising how bad the LLM is at tic-tac-toe, mostly o4-mini,
  although even 4o is not great. I know that the table-styled Nushell output is probably confusing it, and I could
  strip it out, but I like this as a reminder about how fragile real world an integration is. Good example to try more
  examples (few shot). Let's see what happens. I want to explore some variations, but I'm really trying to make an
  eval (though interesting, I would want more scaffolding and design around that, though maybe simple is better). Update:
  wow, o1 is failing at this much more than I anticipated. I asked it to create some examples and in the second example
  it described "X wins in a quick diagonal" but then proceeded to place Xs in the left column and Os extending in a dowright
  diagonal and even asserting "X completes diagonal from (0, a) to (2, c)" but that path is literally X, O and O. I'm
  going to just drop the Nushell table-style and do raw characters (`X`, `O` and `-`). UPDATE 2: Wow, this isn't any better.
  gpt4o botched the game pretty badly. I think I need the many examples. Also I'm tempted to log the full history for
  debugging.
* [ ] Fine-tune a small model over my own content. I'd like to at least do fine-turning once, for the sake of it. This has to happen in the cloud probably, but if I fine-tune a small model I can run inference locally. I want to fine-tune the model with my own README content across all my repositories. Now that I think about it, fine-tuning for small models is probably a good idea because the capability of local models is relatively low, so we want to juice them for a specific task. 
* [ ] "semantic search" product over my own data. I should be able to make that with embeddings? Also take care to note that you can use AI for semantic search, but you don't need *generative* AI for the actual response (I think? We want to "classify" the query as one of a few Q&As...)
* [ ] Split into sub-projects
* [ ] "programmatic" example. I'm particularly interested in the UX of streaming the tokens back as they are generated. I need a programmatic example for this.
