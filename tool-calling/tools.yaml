      Ask the user for the next instruction in the game. At this point, it's the user's turn in the game, and the
      officiator is waiting for them to pick a spot to mark the board or request to restart the game. 'X' (the user
      player) always goes first. It is NOT the user's turn if there are more 'X' marks than 'O' marks on the board.
